# COMPUTER ORGANISATION M21 

# Project made by Naman Kaushik, Heemank Verma and Yashwardhan Chaudhari.
For Computer Organisation Course at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology

The Project has 3 parts: Assembler, Simulator and Graphical representation.

The Assembler is responsible for taking in input as the assembly language and translating it into machine code as specified by the given Instruction Set Architecture.

The Simulator utilizes this machine code to execute the instructions provided. 

The simulation is done on a Von-Neumann based machine and a graph can also be plotted which shows the memory locations accessed at different time intervals.

## How to evaluate
* Go to the `automatedTesting` directory and execute the `run` file with appropiate options passed as arguments.
* Options available for automated testing:
	1. `--verbose`: Prints verbose output
	2. `--no-asm`: Does not evaluate the assembler
	3. `--no-sim`: Does not evaluate the simulator
